# 💡 Experiment 01 – Interfacing a Digital Output (LED) with ARM Development Board

### 🎯 **Aim**
To interface a digital output (LED) to an ARM development board and write a blink code.

---

### ⚙️ **Components Required**
- STM32CubeIDE  
- NUCLEO ARM Development Board  

---

### 🧠 **Theory**

**ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)** is a 32-bit processor architecture developed by ARM Holdings. It is widely used in embedded systems and SoC (System-on-Chip) products. Many semiconductor companies like Samsung, Atmel, and Texas Instruments license ARM architecture to design their own SoCs.
### 🧩 **What is an ARM7 Processor?**
The **ARM7 processor** is commonly used in embedded system applications. It provides a balance between the classic ARM architecture and the newer Cortex series, offering an excellent platform for both hardware and software development.
### 🔍 **LPC2148 Microcontroller**
The **LPC2148**, developed by NXP Semiconductors (Philips), is a 16/32-bit ARM7-based microcontroller featuring a wide range of peripherals.
#### **Key Features**
- 16/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S core in LQFP64 package  
- On-chip **Flash memory**: 32 KB – 512 KB  
- On-chip **SRAM**: 8 KB – 40 KB  
- **ISP/IAP** via on-chip bootloader  
- **Embedded ICE-RT** and **Real Monitor** for real-time debugging  
- **USB 2.0** full-speed device controller with 2 KB endpoint RAM  
- **10-bit ADC** (6 or 14 channels, 2.44 μs conversion time)  
- **10-bit DAC** for analog output  
- **Timers:** Two 32-bit timers, watchdog, and PWM unit  
- **RTC** with 32 kHz clock input  
- **UARTs (2x), I²C (2x)** up to 400 kbit/s  
- **5V-tolerant GPIOs**, 21 external interrupt pins  
- **Max CPU Clock:** 60 MHz using on-chip PLL (lock time 100 µs)  
- **Crystal Frequency:** 1 MHz – 25 MHz  
- **Power modes:** Idle and Power-down with peripheral clock scaling
